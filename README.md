Thank you for your interest in working at sovrn!

We have assembled a project that we'd like you to improve. This project is a simple notepad application, using local storage as a data store. This project will test your abilities with the following technologies:

- Git
- Backbone.js
- HTML5
- Grunt

Your assignment:

1. Clone this repository to your local development environment
2. Install all necessary dependencies
3. Run the app (grunt serve)
5. Add "clear list" functionality
6. Add "remove note" functionality
7. Add sorting functionality (optional)
8. Add your contact info to this file
9. Commit your changes
10. Make a pull request
11. Get a job!


Notes:
- This project is built on Yeoman's Backbone generator.  Take a look at their documentation if you run into trouble.
- This project uses Backbone.localstorage to integrate HTML5's localstorage with Backbone's sync methods
- If you have questions or run into problems, don't worry! Please let us know so that we can continue to improve this project.
